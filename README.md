# Simplified Database System
Project Desctiption
This project is a simplified database system built from scratch to demonstrate
core functionalities such as creating tables, inserting, updating, and deleting records.
While building a full-fledged database system is a complex task, this project provides
a foundation for understanding the basic concepts and operations involved in database management.

Features
Create Tables: Define table structures with column names and data types.
Insert Records: Add new entries into tables.
Update Records: Modify existing data in tables.
View Records: Retrieve and display data stored in tables.
Delete Records: Remove specific records from tables.
File Operations: Save the database to a file and reload it to continue working later.

File Structure
Database Class: Contains methods for table management, CRUD operations, and file handling.
Main Function: Demonstrates how to use the Database class.

Improvements and Future Work
1. Data types: Implement proper data type handling for different column types(int,float,string,etc.)
2. Error Handling: Incorporate error handling for invaalid names,column names,data types and index out of bounds.
3. Query language: Develop a simple query language to interact with the database.
